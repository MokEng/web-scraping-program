		<h2 id="task">Creating/editing tasks</h2>
		<p>
			This window allows you to create Tasks.<br>
			At the top you can select the type of task you want to create. "<b>Text</b>" tasks extract and collect text from elements on the page, <br>
			"<b>Click</b>" simulates a mouse click on an element on the page, and "<b>Navigate</b>" allows you to navigate the scraper to a new URL.<br>
			Clicking on "<b>Select Element</b>" and then clicking on the webpage allows you to select that element. The element will by highlighted and the xPath field will be filled with the path to that element.<br>
			If you want to select other elements connected to the currently selected element, you can use the other "<b>Select</b>" button to select all the elements in the current element, <br>
			all elements in the same parent element as the currently selected one, and the element the contains the current element. You can also press the "<b>&lt;-</b>" to navigate back on step in the webpage history.<br>
			If you want to add a task with the currently selected options, press "<b>Add Task</b>" to add it to the sitemap. Press "<b>Remove Task</b>" to remove the latest task from the sitemap.<br>

		<h2 id="settings">Program settings</h2>
		<p>
			You can access the settings from the "<b>File</b>" menu in the starting window of the application.<br>
			If you are going to store the data locally on you computer, you can specify the storage location by pressing "<b>Open</b>" and navigating to the desired directory.<br>
			If you want to store the data on a MongoDB database, paste the connection string into the field and press "<b>Connect</b>". If the connection string is correct, the text next to the button will turn green.<br>
			You can select what web driver to use from the dropdown menu. If you want to download more drivers, click on the link which will take you to a page with download links. <br>
			Remember that the driver version you download must match the version of the same browser you have installed. <br>
			After the download is finished, press the "<b>Place drivers here</b>" to open the directory where you should place the driver files.<br>
			If you want to speed up the scraping, you can increase the amount of drivers that can run at the same time by moving the slider.<br>
			Keep in mind that more drivers running at the same time results in more memory and CPU usage. The maximum number of drivers you can select is limited by your computer's logical cores.<br>
			If a sitemap only contains a few number of tasks, increasing the number of drivers will have no effect, since a task cannot run on two drivers at the same time.
