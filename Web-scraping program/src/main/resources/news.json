It was a tough game where we suffered on the counterattacks and sometimes we were even lucky, but the team held their shape well and in normal situations we didn\u0027t risk much, defending with order and with a high line. We also had favourable situations in which we could have been more dangerous, but winning in Florence is never easy and the team showed signs of maturity, because today we were missing so many players and it was a difficult match. Ak√© did well too, everyone was good today, but I think Danilo has set an example, proving to be a player of the highest level. Fortunately, Dybala, Rugani and Bernardeschi are back tomorrow and they will bring fresh energy. Now let\u0027s put this match aside, because on Sunday we have a very important match against Spezia.\""},{"id":"6","dataname":"title","data":"JUVENTUS: POST-MATCH COMMENTS FROM FLORENCE"}]},{"groupedBy":"id","taskData":[{"id":"7","dataname":"content","data":"Happy birthday to Bryan Cristante, Roma midfielder, born in San Vito al Tagliamento in 1995."},{"id":"7","dataname":"title","data":"HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO..."}]},{"groupedBy":"id","taskData":[{"id":"8","dataname":"content","data":"On the official Lega Serie A Youtube channel, as in every Serie A TIM round, you can find the Top 5 goals from matchday 27."},{"id":"8","dataname":"title","data":"SERIE A TIM - MATCHDAY 27 TOP 5 GOAL"}]}]
