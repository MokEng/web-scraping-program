# Web-scraping Program #

This repository contains a basic web-scraping application made in Java, using JavaFX and Selenium, made during the course DT002G at Mid Sweden University.
The program allows for scraping text off websites, multithreaded scraping, and scheduling of scraping tasks.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone or download the repository.
* Navigate to the /Web-scraping program directory
* Use `gradlew build` to build the project.
* Use `gradlew run` to run the project.
* Use `gradlew bootJar` to create a runnable .jar-file of the project. In order to make the "Help" menu work correctly, copy the /help directory into the same directory as the .jar-file.
